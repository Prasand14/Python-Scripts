ID3 : A Top Down Learning Algorithm
Sort of Expressiveness
Bias of ID3
"Best" Attributes by Information Gain [Gain(Entropy, Attributes)] or Gain(S,A)
Dealing with Overfitting - Using Pruning to deal with Overfitting

LIMITATIONS:

1. Decision trees are prone to over fitting especially with data
 which has lots and lots of features and a complicated decision tree it
 can over fit the data. So, we have to be careful with the parameter tunes that
 we are picking when we are building a decision tree.
2. Stop the growth of th etree at the appropriate time.

ADVANTAGES:
 
1. With Decision Trees, we can build bigger classifiers out of decision trees in 
 something called ENSEMBLE METHODS [BUILDING A CLASSIFIER OUT OF A CLASSIFIER]
